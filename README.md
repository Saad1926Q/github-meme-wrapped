# **GitHub Meme Wrapped 🎉**  

So, I made my own take on the *Spotify Wrapped* idea, but for GitHub! 😎 In order to give it a bit of my own flair, I decided to **memify** it. It’s not like some huge, super complex project or anything, but I had a ton of fun building it, and I hope you enjoy it too!  

This little app generates a personalized summary of your year on GitHub, showcasing your **contributions**, **PRs**, and the *developer personality* that makes you who you are. You can also share your GitHub Wrapped on Twitter and LinkedIn to show off your year!

## **Developer Personalities You Might Get**  
Based on your GitHub activity, here are some of the fun developer personalities you might get:  

- **Cooked Coder**:  
  "Bro is cooked... Where's the activity?"  
  This coder has gone completely MIA—no activity, no contributions, just vibes. Maybe they’re taking an extended break from coding or lost in another dimension.

- **Chill Coder**:  
  "Just a chill guy. He does just enough to get noticed."  
  This coder is all about balance—doing just enough to get noticed but not going overboard. They code when they feel like it, keeping it cool and stress-free.

- **Touch Grass**:  
  "Take a break, step outside, and touch some grass!"  
  This coder needs to remind themselves that there's life beyond the screen. Maybe step out, get some sun, and rejoin the real world.

- **Streak King/Queen**:  
  "Bro Probably Hasn't Taken a Bath in Ages. 🛁😂🤢😂"  
  This coder is obsessed with maintaining streaks—grinding away on GitHub every single day, regardless of what’s happening in life. True dedication, questionable hygiene.

- **Let Him Cook**:  
  "Bro has been cooking… 🍳🔥"  
  This coder is on the rise! They’ve been quietly working on something big, with a consistent streak of improvement. Definitely a 'watch out for them' vibe.

- **Bro Fell Off**:  
  "Bro fell off. Time for a comeback arc?"  
  This coder was once at the top of their game, but something happened—they stopped pushing, and their contributions tanked. Time for a comeback arc?

- **NPC Coder**:  
  "Just vibing in the background like a true NPC. 🕶️🤖"  
  When no badges are earned, this coder is just going through the motions—doing the bare minimum but staying in the game. A quiet presence, waiting for their moment.
